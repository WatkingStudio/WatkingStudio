# üëã About Me
Hi I am @WatkingStudio, a Software Engineer from the North West England. I have over 5 years professional experience as a Software Engineer, and a degree in Computer Games Programming. I have interests in the creation, reviewing and testing of code.  

This GitHub account is for all of my personal projects that I work on. I currently have a mix of public and private repositories, when I get a project to a 1.0 release I will make it public. If you check out any of my projects and have any feedback or suggestions feel free to get in touch with me, I am always happy to hear constructive feedback and to find ways to improve my code.
# ‚å®Ô∏è Active Coding Projects
## Hurzix Adventure
Hurzix Adventure is a 2D platformer, created in Unity using C#, where the user plays as Hurzix the rare blue wolf. The user must direct Hurzix through numerous zones collecting keys and coins along the way, while also avoiding the enemies who wish to kill Hurzix and stop his progression. Each zone has different visuals, enemies and additional mechanics.
## Tournament Organiser
The tournament creator app was created to assist with the creation and running of a wargaming event, specifically running events for the wargame Middle Earth SBG. This application was created in QtCreator using C++. I ran a couple of small events before creating this app and used pen and paper to record results and determine match-ups. However, when I knew I was going to be running the final event in the Great British Hobbit League 2018 calendar, I knew that I would have to find an alternative method. Following my research of some existing options that other tournament organizers used, I decided to create my own app which would be customized to my requirements. After using the app at several events I continued to develop it, correcting bugs and adding additional features where required.
## Twitch Encounter Script
The Twitch encounter script is a python script created in PyCharm that runs in the Streamlabs Chatbot. It allows viewers of the twitch stream to run Dungeons and Dragons style encounters, rewarding them with loot, experience and comical encounters. There are also organised quests where the viewers can create a questing party to fight a powerful monsters, to gain experience, renown and epic loot.
